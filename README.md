<h1>Expense Tracker web Application</h1>
<h3>Uwase Sophie 24435</3><br>
This is a web app that is used to track expenses on a daily basis and the technologies I used are as follow:
  <p>This App has two parts </p>
    <p> The Backend Parts I used Springboot and Spring Security and JWT</p>
    <p> The Frontend Part I used React Js</p>
    <p>The Database used is Postgresql</p>
    <p>For the testing part I used Postman</p>
    <h3>before Running the backend first create a database called expense_tracker</h3>
    On the Frontend part, you have to install first the dependancies
    
       npm install

  After that everything is Settled!!
