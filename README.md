<h1>Expense Tracker web Application</h1>
This is a web app that is used to track expenses on a daily basis and the technologies I used are as follow:
  <p>This App has two parts </p>
    <p> The Backend Parts I used Springboot and Spring Security and JWT</p>
    <p> The Frontend Part I used React Js</p>
    <p>The Database used is Postgresql</p>
    <p>For the testing part I used Postman</p>
    
    <h3>before Running the backend first create a database called expense_tracker</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For the frontend run npm install, to install the dependencies</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
